horniman_hackathon
==================
Welcome to the Horniman Hackathon. 

The aim of this project is to create a centralised control system for monitoring and controlling temperatures within a confined aquarium environment to allow the succesful mimicing of real world environmental parameters.

This is part of a multi-year project and will inform captive coral husbandry throughout the aquarium industry.
